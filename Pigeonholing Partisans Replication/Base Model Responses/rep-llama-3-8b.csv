","When I am asked to write down four words that typically describe people who support the Republican Party, I respond with: 1."," White 2. Male 3. Old 4. Rich. I am not alone in this assessment. In fact, I am not even in the minority. A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that 80% of Republicans are white, 60% are male, 70% are over the age of 50, and 60% are college graduates. The study also found that 70% of Republicans are married, 60% are Christian, and 50% are Protestant. In other words, the Republican Party is overwhelmingly white, male, old, rich, married, Christian, and Protestant. This is not a coincidence. The Republican Party has been actively courting these demographics for decades. In the 1960s, the Republican Party began to shift to the right, adopting a more conservative platform. This shift was driven by the rise of the New Right, a movement that was largely made up of white, male, old, rich, married, Christian, and Protestant voters. The New Right was led by figures such as Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. These figures were able to tap into the fears and anxieties of white, male, old, rich, married, Christian, and Protestant voters, and use them to their advantage. The New Right was able to win over these voters by promising to protect their way of life, their values, and their interests. The New Right was also able to win over these voters by promising to protect their way of life, their values, and their interests.
